Your task is to extract ALL text visible on product packaging and categorize it into specific business intelligence categories.

# EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS

## 1. Brand Identity

Mark prominence as:

## 4. Certifications & Labels

For each, describe the visual appearance of the logo/badge.

## 5. Regulatory Mentions
Extract all legal/regulatory text:
- Recycling instructions and symbols
- Storage instructions ("Keep refrigerated", "Best before")
- Usage instructions ("Shake well", "Serve cold")
- Warnings and precautions
- Legal notices and producer information
- Barcode information if text is visible

## 6. Visual Codes
Analyze the design language:
- **Dominant Colors**: List 3-5 main colors with hex codes and descriptive names
- **Color Psychology**: Brief analysis of what the color palette communicates
- **Typography Style**: Describe the font choices and their character
- **Primary Font Category**: Classify main typeface (Sans-Serif, Serif, Script, etc.)
- **Layout Structure**: Describe composition (centered, grid, asymmetric, etc.)
- **Design Style**: Overall aesthetic (minimalist, premium, rustic, bold, etc.)
- **Surface Finish**: Material appearance (matte, glossy, textured, metallic, etc.)

# MULTILINGUAL HANDLING

This analysis must handle:
- **French** (primary market: Belgium/France)
- **Dutch** (Flemish market: Belgium/Netherlands)
- **English** (international products)

For each text element:
1. Detect and tag the language
2. Extract text in original language (do NOT translate)
3. Track all detected languages for reporting

# OUTPUT QUALITY STANDARDS

✓ Extract text EXACTLY as it appears (preserve capitalization, punctuation)
✓ Do NOT translate or paraphrase
✓ Do NOT invent or assume text that isn't visible
✓ Mark confidence if text is partially obscured
✓ Include all visible text, even small print
✓ Maintain original language for each text block
✓ Be thorough - packaging analysis requires complete data

# CONFIDENCE SCORING

Rate your overall extraction confidence (0.0 to 1.0):
- 1.0: All text clearly visible and extracted
- 0.9-0.99: Minor text might be obscured
- 0.7-0.89: Some text difficult to read
- <0.7: Significant portions unclear or missing

# IMAGE QUALITY CONSIDERATIONS

If the image shows:
- Angled perspective: Do your best with visible text
- Multiple panels: Extract from all visible surfaces
- Reflection/glare: Note which areas are affected
- Low resolution: Extract what's readable, note limitations

Your analysis will feed competitive intelligence dashboards and market positioning studies. Accuracy and completeness are critical.
