Analyze this product image and identify the front-facing view of the packaging.

**Product Context:**
- Brand: {brand}
- Product: {product_name}
- Category: {category}

**Your Task:**

1. Examine the image and identify what type of product shot this is (front-facing, angled, multiple items, lifestyle, etc.)

2. Determine if a front-facing view can be extracted:
   - Is the front face of the packaging visible?
   - Can you clearly identify the boundaries?
   - Is there a single main product to extract?

3. If extraction is possible, provide PRECISE bounding box coordinates:
   - Format: [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax] normalized to 0-1000 scale
   - Include the ENTIRE front face with minimal padding
   - Exclude external marketing elements, shadows, reflections

4. Explain your analysis and any notable observations about the image composition.

**Remember:**
- The bounding box will be used for DIRECT PIXEL CROPPING - no perspective correction
- For angled products, select the rectangular area that best captures the front face
- For multiple products, isolate the MAIN product only
- Accuracy of coordinates is critical - the crop will be exactly as you specify
